## Introduction

A collection of Node-RED nodes to control your smart home devices via Google Assistant or the Google Home App.

What this module does NOT:
It does not directly interface with devices made by Google, for example Nest thermostats 

---
## Prerequisites

1. You are going to need a 'real' SSL certificate e.g. from [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
2. You also need to be able to forward TCP traffic coming in from the Internet to your Node-RED server on a port you
specify. This is not your full Node-RED server but a service started by `node-red-contrib-google-smarthome`, providing
only the functions needed by Google.
3. This package requires NodeJS version 7.6.0 at a minimum. If, during start of Node-RED, you get this warning, your version on NodeJS is too old:
`[warn] [node-red-contrib-google-smarthome/google-smarthome] SyntaxError: Unexpected token ( (line:30)`

---
## Setup Instructions

#### Create and set up project in Actions Console

See the developer guide and release notes at https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/overview for more details.

1. Go to [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com).
1. Click on *New project* to add a new project with a name and language of your choice and click *Create Project*. 
1. Choose type *Smart Home*, then click *Start Building*.
1. From the top menu under *Develop*, click on *Invocation*.
1. Enter your App's name. Click *Save*.
1. On the *Develop* tab, choose *Actions* on the left menu. Enter the URL for fulfillment, e.g. https://example.com:3001/smarthome. Leave all other fields empty. Click *Save*.
1. Still on the *Develop* tab, choose *Account linking* on the left menu. Fill out the fields as following:
    * Client ID and secret: Credentials, with wich Google will authenticate against your app. Use a password generator tool
      to generate two strings of reasonable length and complexity. Copy both strings, you'll need them later.
    * Authorization URL: is the hosted URL of your app with '/oauth' as the path, e.g. https://example.com:3001/oauth.
    * Token URL: is the hosted URL of your app with '/token' as the path, e.g. https://example.com:3001/token.
    * Leave all other fields empty.
1. Click *Save*.
1. You don't need to fill in anything on the *Deploy* tab.
1. On tab *Test*, click *Reset Test*.

*Note:* Adjust the URLs like https://example.com:3001/smarthome to your own hostname, port and settings.

#### Enable HomeGraph API

The HomeGraph API is used to report the state of your devices to Google and to request a SYNC to inform Google about new or updated devices.

1. Go to the [Home Graph API on Google Cloud Console API Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/homegraph.googleapis.com/overview).
1. In the header bar select your project from the project chooser.
1. Enable the [HomeGraph API].
1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console API & Services page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
1. Again, select your project in the header bar.
1. Select *Create Credentials* and create a *Service account key*.
1. Enter a name for your service account and click *Create*.
1. You don't need to add roles or user in the next steps.
1. Your new service account is listed on the Credentials page. Click on it.
1. Click on *Add Key* to create a new key of type JSON.
1. Download the JSON file and copy it to your Node-RED server, in a location where the Node-RED service can read it.

#### Integrating Google Sign-In

The Google Sign-In feature allows to login using your Google credentials. See [Integrating Google Sign-In into your web app](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in) for more datails.
If you want to use login with username/password instead, skip this section.

1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console API & Services page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
1. From the project drop-down, select your project.
1. In the sidebar under "APIs & Services", select Credentials, then click Configure consent screen.
1. Choose an Email Address, specify a Product Name, and press Save.
1. In the Credentials tab, select the Create credentials drop-down list, and choose OAuth client ID.
1. Under Application type, select Web application.
1. Register the origins from which your app is allowed to access the Google APIs, as follows.
    * In the Authorized JavaScript origins field, enter the hosted URL of your app, e.g. https://example.com:3001
    * The Authorized redirect URI field does not require a value.
    * Press the Create button.
1. From the resulting OAuth client dialog box, copy the Client ID. You will need it later.

#### Install and configure Node-RED module

1. Install `node-red-contrib-google-smarthome` from Node-RED's palette and restart Node-RED.
1. Place the Management node from the section "Google Smart Home" on a flow.
1. Edit the management node and open its config. Fill in the fields as following:
    * Name: A name for your config node.
    * Use Google Login: Check, if you want to use authentication via Google Sign-In.
    * Login Client ID: If Google Login is enabled, the client id you gained from the *Google Sign-In* integration.
    * Authorized emails: If Google Login is enabled, the email adresses, semicolon-separated, authorized to log in.  
    * Username/Password: If Google Login is disabled, the credentials you want to use when linking your account in the Google Home App later. These are not the credentials to your Google account!
    * Client ID and Secret: The same strings you generated and entered on Google Search Console earlier.
    * Jwt Key: The JSON file you downloaded earlier. Can be an absolute path or a path relative to Node-REDs user dir.
    * Port: The port on which the service should run. If left empty, it will run on the same port as Node-RED.
    * Path: URL path on which the service will run. If left empty, https://example.com:3001/smarthome will be used. If set, it will be https://example.com:3001/<yourpath>/smarthome.
    * Use external SSL offload: Check, if you want do SSL decryption on an external load balancer.
    * Public and Private Key: Path to public and private key of your SSL certificate (if you do not use external SSL decryption).
1. Deploy the flow.
1. Check if your service is reachable from the internet. Use a tool like https://reqbin.com to send a GET request to https://example.com:3001/check (using your domain name and port). It must answer with status 200 and the message "SUCCESS".

#### Setup Account linking

1. Open the Google Home App on a device logged into the same account used to create the project in the Actions Console.
1. Click the '+' sign to add a device.
1. Click *Set up device*.
1. Click *Have something already set up*.
1. Find your app in the list of providers. It will be `[test]` and then your app name.
1. Log in to your service. Username and password are the ones you specified in the configuration node.
1. Start using the Google Assistant.

## Nodes in this package
### General information
1. If `online` is set to `false` for a node, Google SmartHome is not going to be able to control the node. It will also show as `offline` in the Google Home app.
2. The nodes will do their best to convert incoming payload data to the required type. You can send a string of e.g. `ON` and it will be converted to `true`.
3. Topics must be either as stated below or prepended with one or more `/`. E.g. `my/topic/on`. The nodes only looks for the part after the last `/`, if any.

#### - Light On/Off (a light that can be switched on and off only)

#### - Management
`topic` can be `restart_server`, `report_state` or `request_sync`.

`payload` is not used for anything.

`restart_server` is used to stop then start the built-in webserver. Can be used when your SSL certificate has been renewed and needs to be re-read by the webserver.

`report_state` will force an update of all states to Google. Mostly usefull for debugging.

`request_sync` will request Google to sync to learn about new or changed devices. This usually happens automatically.

## The config node

**Local Authentication**

  `Use Google Login`: If enabled, use the Google login authentication.

  `Login Client ID`: If Google Login is enabled, The client id you gained from the *Google Sign-In* integration.

  `Authorized emails`: If Google Login is enabled, The email adresses, semicolon-separated, authorized to log in.

  `Username` and `Password`: If Google Login is disabled, a username and password used when you link Google SmartHome to this node.
  
  `Token Duration`: The authorization token duration used by Google SmartHome to identify itself to node-red SmartHome plugin. Default is 60 minutes.

**Actions on Google Project Settings**

  `Client ID`: The client id you entered in the *Google on Actions* project.

  `Client Secret`: The client secret you entered in the *Google on Actions* project.

**Google HomeGraph Settings**

  `Jwt Key`: Full or relative to the Node-RED config folder path to JWT key file (the one downloaded in the *Add Report State* section).

  `Report Interval (m)`: Time, in minutes, between report updates are sent to Google.

**Web Server Settings**

  `Use http Node-RED root path`: If enabled, use the same http root path prefix configured for Node-RED, otherwise use /.

  `Path`: Prefix for URLs provided by this module. Default fulfillment URL is https://example.com:3001/smarthome. With a
          path of "foo" this changes to https://example.com:3001/foo/smarthome. Same for URLs `/oauth` and `/token`.

  `Port`: TCP port of your choosing for incoming connections from Google. Must match what you entered in the *Google on Actions* project.

  `Use external SSL offload`: If enabled, SSL encryption is not used by the node and must be done elsewhere.

  `Public Key`: Full path to public key file, e.g. `fullchain.pem` from Let's Encrypt.

  `Private Key`: Full path to private key file, e.g. `privkey.pem` from Let's Encrypt.

## Troubleshooting

- Some devices can be controlled via voice, but not via Google Home App. For example windows and sensors. These devices
  only show a general page with their room assignments in the app, but they don't show their current state or buttons to
  control it. There is nothing we can do about it, this has to be implemented by Google. 
- Some errors and possible solutions are listed at
  [Possible errors](https://github.com/mikejac/node-red-contrib-google-smarthome/wiki/Possible-errors).
- Look at Node-Red's debug panel for error messages.
- Unlink and relink your account in the Google Home app. Meanwhile look for errors in the debug panel.
- Restart your flows (using the `Restart Flows` option in the dropdown menu of the deploy button) while the debug panel
  is open to see error messages during initialization.
- Go to [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com), in tab *Test* choose *View logs in Google Cloud Platform*.
- Check if your service is reachable from the outside. Use [reqbin.com](https://reqbin.com/) or a similar tool to
  send a GET request to https://example.com:3001/check (with your hostname and port). It must answer with status
  200 (OK) and the message "SUCCESS". Use https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ to check your SSL certificate.
- Check Node-RED's log output. Where you find this depends on how you installed Node-Red. Usually something like
  `journalctl -u nodered`, `docker logs <container>` or a file in `/var/log`. 
- Toggle "Enable Node debug" in the configuration node, connect a debug node to the output of the management node and
  look for debug messages. In Node-Red UI choose 'Restart Flows' on the 'Deploy' button to see messages during
  initialization.
- Go to [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com), on tab *Test* click *Reset Test*. If this
  doesn't do anything, click the *Settings* button, disable "On device testing", then enable it again.
- Google might say that it cannot reach your device if that device did not update its state at least once after creation.
