            <li><b>CameraStream</b>: This trait belongs to devices which have the capability to stream video feeds to third party screens, Chromecast-connected screens, or smartphones. By and large, these are security cameras or baby cameras. But this trait also applies to more complex devices which have a camera on them (for example, video-conferencing devices or a vacuum robot with a camera on it).</li>
            <li><b>Channel</b>: This trait belongs to devices that support TV channels on a media device.</li>
            <li><b>ColorSetting</b>: This trait applies to devices, such as smart lights, that can change color or color temperature.</li>
            <li><b>Cook</b>: This trait belongs to devices that can cook food according to various food presets and supported cooking modes.</li>
            <li><b>Dispense</b>: This trait belongs to devices that support dispensing a specified amount of one or more physical items.

Each mode has multiple possible settings, but only one can be selected at a time; a dryer cannot be in "delicate," "normal," and "heavy duty" mode simultaneously. A setting that simply can be turned on or off belongs in the Toggles trait.</li>
            <li><b>NetworkControl</b>: This trait belongs to devices that support reporting network data and performing network specific operations.</li>
            <li><b>ObjectDetection</b>: This trait belongs to devices that can detect objects or people and send a notification to the user. For example, it can be used for doorbells to indicate that a person (named or unnamed) rang the doorbell, as well as for cameras and sensors that can detect movement of objects or people approaching.</li>

            <li><b>Scene</b>: In the case of scenes, the type maps 1:1 to the trait, as scenes don't combine with other traits to form composite devices.</li>

            <li><b>StartStop</b>: Starting and stopping a device serves a similar function to turning it on and off. Devices that inherit this trait function differently when turned on and when started. Unlike devices that simply have an on and off state, some devices that can start and stop are also able to pause while performing operation.</li>

            <li><b>TemperatureControl</b>: Trait for devices (other than thermostats) that support controlling temperature, either within or around the device. This includes devices such as ovens and refrigerators.</li>
            <li><b>TemperatureSetting</b>: This trait covers handling both temperature point and modes.</li>
            <li><b>Timer</b>: The Timer trait represents a timer on a device, primarily kitchen appliances such as ovens and microwaves, but not limited to them.</li>
            <li><b>Toggles</b>: This trait belongs to any devices with settings that can only exist in one of two states. These settings can represent a physical button with an on/off or active/inactive state, a checkbox in HTML, or any other sort of specifically enabled/disabled element.</li>

        <p><b>Note 1:</b> <code>msg.topic</code> does not have to be exactly as shown above. You can use <code>/</code> as
        a delimiter and as long as the last part of the topic matches one of the described topics all is good.
        For example, <code>a/msg/topic/online</code> will be broken down into multiple parts and only the last part, 
        <code>online</code>, will be tested for a match.</p>
        <p><b>Note 2:</b> If you set the online state to <code>false</code> then Google Smart Home is not going to be 
        able to control the device.</p>

        <h4>Output Messages</h4>
        <p>Unless <code>Pass Through</code> is enabled, these messages are emitted when Google Smart Home wants to control the device.</p>
